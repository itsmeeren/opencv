waitkey()
It's often used in conjunction with cv2.imshow() to display images and keep the window open until a key is pressed.

video=cv.VideoCapture('cat.mp4')
while True:
    isTrue, frame = video.read()
    cv.imshow('video',frame)
    if cv.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break
video.release()

above if the key q is pressed it will stop the loop

Image resizing

def imageresize(frame,scale=0.75):
    width = int(frame.shape[1] * scale)
    height = int(frame.shape[0] * scale)
    return cv.resize(frame,(width,height),interpolation=cv.INTER_AREA)


 Main functions in openCV

 Edge cascading is a technique used to detect edges in images. It involves applying a series of edge detectors,
 each tuned to detect edges at different scales and orientations.

Dilation: Dilation expands the boundaries of objects in an image. It's useful for filling in holes or gaps in objects.

Erosion: Erosion shrinks the boundaries of objects in an image. It's useful for removing small noise or imperfections
